## 🏝️ Island Progression Overview

### 🗺️ Correct Island Order

```
Island 1 → Island 2 → Return to Island 1 (Archer Upgrade) → Island 3 → Island 4 → Island 5 → Island 6 → Cave
```

**🎯 Expert Player Consensus**: Return to Island 1 **immediately after Island 2** for the archer upgrade. This timing is optimal because:

- Island 2 provides exactly the gems needed (6 gems total)
- Ship costs are cheapest early in the game
- Archer power spike helps with all subsequent islands
- Experienced players unanimously recommend this sequence

### 💎 **Why Immediate Return After Island 2 Works Best:**

**Resource Efficiency:**

- Island 2 gives you **exactly 6 gems** from chests and clearing
- Archer upgrade costs **3 gems + 10 coins**
- You'll have sufficient resources without over-investing

**Economic Advantages:**

- **Cheapest ship cost**: Early game boats cost much less
- **Faster progression**: Less total travel time than waiting
- **Earlier power spike**: Archer buff helps with Islands 3-6

**Strategic Benefits:**

- **Island 1 still defended**: Your initial defenses should still be intact
- **Quick mission**: Land, upgrade, leave immediately
- **Combat readiness**: Face Island 3's challenges with powered-up archers

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes & How to Avoid Them

### 🚫 Critical Errors for Beginners

#### 1. **Insufficient Early Defense**

❌ **Mistake**: Building only 1-2 walls per side on early islands
✅ **Solution**: Always build 3+ walls minimum, upgrade outer walls first

#### 2. **Poor Resource Management**

❌ **Mistake**: Spending all coins immediately without planning
✅ **Solution**: Always keep 10+ coins reserve for emergencies

#### 3. **Neglecting Town Center Upgrades**

❌ **Mistake**: Staying at Tent level too long
✅ **Solution**: Upgrade to Advanced Wood House by Day 4-5 on each island

#### 4. **Inadequate Military Balance**

❌ **Mistake**: All archers OR all Squires
✅ **Solution**: Balanced army: 60% archers, 40% Squires for optimal defense

#### 5. **Poor Cooperative Coordination**

❌ **Mistake**: Both players doing same tasks, no communication
✅ **Solution**: Clear role division, constant communication, shared planning

#### 6. **Skipping the Archer Upgrade**

❌ **Mistake**: Not returning to Island 1 for the Statue of Archery after Island 2  
✅ **Solution**: ALWAYS return to Island 1 immediately after Island 2 (Day 12-15) for this critical upgrade

### 🔧 Recovery Strategies

#### If You Lose an Island:

1. **Don't panic** - islands can be reclaimed
2. **Rebuild from strongest remaining island**
3. **Gather larger army** before attempting reclaim
4. **Focus on heavy Squire recruitment** for assault

#### If Running Behind Schedule:

1. **Skip optional upgrades** focus on essentials only
2. **Reduce defense on earlier islands** to speed progression
3. **Prioritize critical path**: Islands 1→3→5→Cave
4. **Consider difficulty reduction** if struggling significantly
